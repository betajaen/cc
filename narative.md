CC Compiler for the DX8A
------------------------

The DX8/DX8A computer is a fantasy computer, which pretended to be made
in the 1980s; with a backstory to it.

Additional tools and support structure is required for the DX8/DX8A
computers to function; like this C compiler.

Although this C compiler is written in the future (2018), it's narrative
in comments, code structure and design is written as if it was in 1984.

You'll see code practises and design that were common of that era.
Techniques and algorithms that may appear common today may not be used 
because they do not fit in the narative.

In particular this compiler is based around the First Edition of
The C Programming Language. Although down to time restraints and
interest it will only be a subset of that language.
